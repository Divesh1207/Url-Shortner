This repository demonstrates the basic fundamentals of building a full stack application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It provides a clear and structured approach, covering both backend and frontend development, and how to integrate the two effectively.

The goal of this project is to help beginners understand the core concepts and thought processes involved in creating dynamic and scalable web applications.

## Key Features
- **Backend Setup**: Establishing a server with Express and connecting to a MongoDB database.
- **Frontend Design**: Building and styling components using React.js.
- **API Integration**: Connecting the frontend with the backend to create a seamless user experience.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own projects.

Happy coding!
